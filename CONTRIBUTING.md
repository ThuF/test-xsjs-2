# Contribution Guidelines

## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to project "XSK". It's people like you that make this such a great framework.

You must be aware of the Apache License (which describes contributions) and accept the Developer Certificate of Origin. This is common practice in major Open Source projects. To make this process as simple as possible, we are using [CLA assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/) for individual contributions. CLA assistant is an open source tool that integrates with GitHub very well and enables a one-click experience for accepting the CLA. For company contributors, special rules apply. See the respective section below for details.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Due to legal reasons, contributors will be asked to accept a DCO before they submit the first pull request to this projects, this happens in an automated fashion during the submission process. SAP uses [the standard DCO text of the Linux Foundation](https://developercertificate.org/).
